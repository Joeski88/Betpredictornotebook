## Project Overview
The **Sports Betting Predictor Dashboard** is a Streamlit-based application that leverages predictive analytics to provide betting insights for sports enthusiasts. This dashboard allows users to upload data, perform exploratory analysis, generate predictions for match outcomes, and evaluate model performance.

---

## Features
- **Data Upload:** Upload and preprocess sports datasets (CSV/Excel).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Interactive data visualization and analysis tools.
- **Predict Outcomes:** Generate single-event or batch predictions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Analyze model performance with metrics and visualizations.
- **Settings:** Customize preferences like model selection and appearance.

## Business Case Assessment

### Objectives
- Enable users to make data-driven decisions for sports betting.
- Provide accessible tools for exploring and analyzing sports data.
- Offer an interactive and user-friendly interface for predictions and insights.

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Users gain insights into data trends and model predictions.
2. **User Engagement:** The interactive interface fosters exploration and better understanding of predictions.
3. **Efficiency:** Automates data cleaning, visualization, and predictive analytics, saving time.

### Risks
- **Data Quality:** Users may upload incomplete or incorrect datasets.
- **Model Accuracy:** Predictions depend on the quality and relevance of training data.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Some users may require guidance to interpret visualizations and predictions.

### Proposed Solution
Develop a robust, easy-to-use dashboard with clear instructions, interactive visualizations, and reliable predictive models. Provide error handling and informative feedback to users for a seamless experience.
