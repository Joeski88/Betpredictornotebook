             application of data science, heavily influenced by statistical
             methods, probability theory, and stochastic processes. 
             This Jupyter Notebook has explored how historical data, 
             predictive modelling, and probabilistic reasoning can enhance 
             decision-making in football betting.""")
             
    st.write("""A key aspect of football analytics lies in understanding the
             stochastic nature of the sport. Football outcomes are inherently
             unpredictable due to the vast number of influencing
             variablesâ€”ranging from player form and tactics to weather
             conditions and refereeing decisions.""")
             
    st.write("""Bayes' Theorem plays a crucial role in updating probabilities based
             on new information. In the context of football betting, Bayesian
             inference allows us to continuously refine our expectations of a
             team's performance by incorporating new data, such as injuries,
             recent form, or tactical changes. This dynamic approach ensures
             that predictive models remain adaptable rather than relying solely
             on historical trends.""")
             
    st.write("""While advanced analytics can provide an edge, it is important to
             recognise the limits of prediction in such an unpredictable sport.
             No model can account for every factor influencing a match,
             and variance will always play a role. 
             However, by leveraging data-driven insights,
             understanding stochastic principles, and applying Bayesian
             reasoning, we can make more informed betting decisions and
             improve our long-term betting strategy.""")
