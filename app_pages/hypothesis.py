    We hypothesize that by leveraging historical football match data, including:
    - Team statistics (e.g., goals scored, goals conceded, FT results).
    - Recent match performance (e.g., win/loss streaks).
    - Player statistics (e.g., top scorer, key injuries).
    - Match conditions (e.g., home/away advantage).

    We can use machine learning to:
    1. Predict match outcomes (win/draw/lose) with high accuracy.
    2. Provide data-driven insights for better decision-making in 
    football betting.

    ### Assumptions
    - The predictions depend on the availability and quality of historical data.
    - The accuracy of the predictor may vary based on external factors 
    (e.g., unexpected injuries, referee decisions).

    By integrating these insights into a Streamlit app, we aim to create an 
    interactive, user-friendly interface for analyzing predictions and 
    visualizing match data.
